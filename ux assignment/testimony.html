        "I can confidently say that my journey in Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) was one of the best times in my life.
        ODAC has changed my lifestyle completely in an amazing way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Sec 1, I was an introvert and unsure if I made the right choice. But from the moment I joined, I was welcomed with open arms.
        ODAC was not just a CCA — it was a family. Each session included outdoor skills, fitness, and bonding games.
      </p>
      <p>
        These experiences taught me first-aid, knot tying, kayaking, orienteering, and rock climbing — helping me overcome fears and build confidence.
        Becoming President wasn’t easy, but I was supported by my peers. I’ve grown in ways I never expected.

      <h2 class="text-success">Vice President's Testimony (2023–2024)</h2>
      <p class="fw-bold">Leandro Leow Shao Hng</p>
      <p>
        "ODAC has given me a rare opportunity to lead as Vice President of Programme.
        This experience has been a spectacular journey, and I hope the fun will not stop even after I graduate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was hard to adapt to ODAC's high physical demands, my seniors were kind and patient,
        giving me advice to improve and enjoy the CCA fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leading a large CCA can be tough, but I enjoy planning activities and seeing them come to life.
        Camps and competitions made me feel included and allowed me to grow.
      </p>
